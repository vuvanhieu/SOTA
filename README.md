# SOTA

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
## GPT-4 (OpenAI): 
The fourth generation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, known for its capability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
## BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): 
Developed by Google, BERT is designed for understanding the context of words in search queries.

## T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer): 
This model treats all NLP tasks as a text-to-text problem, making it highly versatile.

## RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach): 
An optimized version of BERT, developed by Facebook AI, with improved performance on various NLP tasks.

## XLNet: 
A generalized autoregressive pretraining method that outperforms BERT on several benchmarks.

# Computer Vision
## Vision Transformers (ViT): 
These models apply transformer architectures, which are traditionally used in NLP, to images, achieving excellent performance on image classification tasks.

## EfficientNet: 
Known for its efficiency and high performance on image classification benchmarks.

## ResNet (Residual Networks): 
Widely used for image recognition tasks, with deep residual learning frameworks.

## Swin Transformer: 
A hierarchical vision transformer model that has achieved SOTA results on various vision tasks.
Multimodal Models

## CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining): 
Developed by OpenAI, this model learns visual concepts from natural language descriptions, enabling powerful zero-shot capabilities.

## DALL-E: 
Also from OpenAI, it generates images from textual descriptions, pushing the boundaries of multimodal understanding.
Reinforcement Learning

## AlphaZero: 
Developed by DeepMind, AlphaZero has demonstrated superhuman performance in chess, shogi, and Go by learning through self-play.

## MuZero: 
An extension of AlphaZero that learns a model of the environment it is interacting with, making it more general.
